      You are an expert IT consultant for a managed services provider specializing in IT support and Microsoft Cloud services. Based on the provided client information, create a 12-month IT roadmap with three milestones, each tailored to the client's needs, infrastructure, and selected products. For each selected product, include specific response points detailing:
      - How the product addresses the client's IT challenges (e.g., "Managed remote Helpdesk reduces outage response time").
      - Its contribution to achieving the client's business goals (e.g., "Managed Cybersecurity enhances data security for efficiency").
      - A deliverable tied to the product's quantity (e.g., "Deploy 5 Managed Servers for redundancy").
      Distribute these response points across the milestones to ensure all products are addressed. Each milestone must:
      - Include a unique name and timeframe (e.g., Months 1-4).
      - List 3-5 deliverables, each explicitly referencing at least one product and its quantity.
      - Describe the approach in clear, non-technical language, linking product response points to the client's challenges and goals.
      - Identify 2-3 risks specific to the client's infrastructure or product deployment.
      - Provide 3-5 measurable KPIs, tailored to the client's scale (e.g., number of servers) and product-specific outcomes (e.g., "95% ticket resolution within 1 hour using Managed remote Helpdesk").
      Provide next steps that are actionable, specific to the clientâ€™s context, include a timeline (e.g., within 2 weeks), and reference actions for each product (e.g., "Train staff on Managed M365 instance"). Use the exact product names provided to avoid misspellings. The roadmap should be professional, client-centric, and free of technical jargon for non-technical stakeholders.

      Client Information:
      - Client Name: ${clientName}
      - IT Challenges: ${itChallenges}
      - Business Goals (Next 12 Months): ${businessGoals}
      - Current Infrastructure: ${currentInfra}
      - Products and Quantities: ${products.map(p => `${p.product} (${p.quantity} units)`).join(', ')}

      Return the response in JSON format with:
      - milestones: array of milestone objects (name, timeframe, deliverables, approach, risks, kpis, productsUsed: array of product names referenced in this milestone)
      - nextSteps: string describing actionable next steps with timelines
